# Post-M5 refactor design and execution plan

Date: 2026-07-28
Baseline: `origin/main@e4790ce857056050a90a4adeef391375e8ce5f19`
Status: **draft frozen for Fable design review; implementation has not started**

## Authority and change control

This file is the single source of truth for the post-M5 refactor. Chat summaries,
PR descriptions, reviewer messages, and generated inventories may point here but
must not become independent copies of the design.

Any change to a locked decision, priority, protected surface, PR boundary, or
review gate must update this file first and add an entry to the decision-change
log at the end. A material design change invalidates the current Fable design
verdict and requires a new one before implementation continues.

Snapshot metrics are evidence about the named baseline, not evergreen truths.
Rebaseline them after any merge that touches a target surface. Executable
inventories must fail on drift; prose counts are never the enforcement
mechanism.

## Goal

Reduce the amount of unrelated code an agent must understand and edit for a
bounded Wenlan change, while preserving:

- one daemon-owned database and one `MemoryDB` facade;
- existing SQL, transaction, async-lock, API, and wire behavior;
- the canonical write and enrichment paths;
- M5 claim identity, truth-state, edge-rebuild, and reader-cutover contracts;
- executable completeness checks rather than review promises.

This is a structure and change-safety refactor. It is not permission to redesign
the database, introduce repository traits, change public APIs, rewrite SQL, or
clean up adjacent code.

## Baseline evidence

Measured on the baseline above:

| Surface | Current evidence |
|---|---:|
| all tracked Rust | 367,929 lines |
| `crates/wenlan-core/src/db.rs` | 94,744 lines, 25.7% of tracked Rust |
| main `db.rs` test module | begins at line 49,059; about 45,686 lines |
| `MemoryDB::run_migrations` | 5,017 lines |
| `db/claim_identity.rs` | 946 production lines |
| `db/edges_rebuild.rs` | 556 production lines |
| M5 external DB tests | 2,219 lines across two files |
| server route registrations | 156 `.route(` occurrences |
| `memory_routes.rs` public handlers | 95 |
| MCP tool declarations | 29 |
| public request/response wire types | 129 |
| root + core `AGENTS.md` | 71,679 bytes |

M5 established the preferred DB seam: child modules contain inherent
`impl MemoryDB` blocks, tests live in sibling files, and `db.rs` retains module
wiring plus migration orchestration. M5 added 1,502 lines of production DB code
and 2,219 lines of DB tests outside `db.rs`, while `db.rs` itself grew by only
131 net lines.

Rust LSP on this baseline can enumerate `db.rs` document symbols and resolve a
child-module `MemoryDB` definition back to `db.rs`. A whole-workspace
`MemoryDB` reference query still times out. File decomposition has therefore
improved local navigation but has not removed the supernode.

The M5 internal-reader generator currently reports:

- 191 total internal page-prose readers;
- 22 exposure paths;
- depth partition `54 / 50 / 87`.

Its committed inventory still says `190 / 22`. The extra live row is
`wenlan-server::memory_routes::handle_create_page`, which reads the persisted
page after creation. The generator self-test passes, so this is an artifact
freshness gap, not a self-test failure. Until set equality is executable, the
inventory is evidence but not a refactor gate.

`crate::db::tests::test_db` and DB test hooks are used widely outside `db.rs`.
Moving the main test module must preserve the exact
`crate::db::tests::*` module path and visibility.

## Locked design decisions

### D1 — one facade, child inherent impl modules

Keep one public `MemoryDB` facade. Move cohesive implementations into
`db/<domain>.rs` as inherent `impl MemoryDB` blocks, following
`claim_identity.rs`, `edges_rebuild.rs`, `page_map.rs`, and the existing scoped
modules.

Do not create a repository trait per table or domain. Trait extraction is
allowed only when a real second implementation or an existing boundary requires
one.

### D2 — movement and behavior never share a PR

A movement PR may change paths, module declarations, and visibility only as
required to preserve the same symbols. It may not rewrite SQL, change query
shape, alter transaction boundaries, rename public methods, or clean up nearby
code.

A later behavior PR must start from the moved, verified baseline and carry its
own RED test.

### D3 — tests leave `db.rs` before production domains

First move the main `pub(crate) mod tests` body out of `db.rs` while preserving:

- the module path `crate::db::tests`;
- `test_db`, shared locks, and test-hook visibility;
- ignored-test names used by runbooks;
- the exact discovered test inventory.

The first move may produce one large external test file. Domain-by-domain test
splitting is a later mechanical series; combining both transformations would
make missing tests harder to detect.

### D4 — connection encapsulation is the last DB step

Do not make `MemoryDB::conn` private at the start. First introduce or move the
domain methods that replace direct access, one caller group at a time.

During the refactor:

- no new direct `.conn.lock().await` outside the DB subtree;
- the existing external set must decrease monotonically;
- final target: no direct connection access outside the DB implementation
  boundary, except explicitly justified test support.

### D5 — M5 surfaces are protected until their cutover sequence clears

Until M5 PR-B/PR-C are merged, or the M5 owner explicitly coordinates the
change, do not structurally move:

- `db/claim_identity.rs`;
- `db/edges_rebuild.rs`;
- migrations 98 and 99;
- page truth-state readers or adapters;
- human-edit-delta and support-edge write paths;
- reader addresses consumed by the M5 manifest;
- the canonical page-write seam needed by the exact-base save path.

R0 may strengthen the reader inventory because that reduces risk without moving
production behavior. R1 and later wait at this gate if PR-B/PR-C remain active.

### D6 — executable change maps precede broad movement

Any inventory used to assert completeness must be regenerated from the current
tree and compared by set equality in a test or CI-visible verifier. Line-number
lists and hand-maintained prose tables are not gates.

For reader movement, the guard must cover the symbol/address set and its
partition. For test movement, it must cover test names before and after. For
public APIs, it must cover exported symbol or typed-contract shape.

### D7 — one writer per hot file

Only one worker edits a hot file or module family in a PR. Parallel agents may
audit, review, measure, or prepare a non-overlapping later slice; they do not
concurrently rewrite `db.rs`, `post_write.rs`, `memory_routes.rs`, or
`scheduler.rs`.

## Impact order

### 1. `db.rs` modularization

Highest impact because it is simultaneously the largest file, the most
frequently touched normalized path, the DB facade, the migration registry, and
the shared test-fixture home.

Agent effect:

- smaller local symbol and context set;
- fewer unrelated SQL blocks in a normal edit;
- more reliable document-symbol and definition navigation;
- narrower diffs and reviewer blast radius.

### 2. HTTP, wire, and MCP vertical slices

Split server handlers and route wiring by product domain while keeping
`wenlan-types` as the typed boundary and MCP typed deserialization intact.

Agent effect:

- one feature change has a discoverable route/handler/type/tool path;
- fewer cross-file searches to find the complete public contract;
- contract tests can bind a vertical slice instead of a monolithic router.

This waits behind the M5 reader-adapter work because both touch the same
surfaces.

### 3. `post_write` internal phases

Keep the canonical page-write facade. Separate validation, planning, storage,
and post-commit work behind it without creating another writer.

Agent effect:

- mutations continue to have one obvious gate;
- a validator or planner change does not require loading all write-path tests;
- agents are less likely to bypass CAS, evidence, or exact-base rules.

### 4. daemon startup and scheduler orchestration

Extract named startup phases and scheduler-lane registration while preserving
ordering and lifecycle semantics.

Agent effect:

- startup and one ambient lane become independently navigable and testable;
- adding a job no longer requires editing one large control-flow body;
- lifecycle regressions remain visible at the registry/orchestrator boundary.

### 5. agent instruction surface

Move drift-prone facts into executable checks or narrowly loaded references.
Keep always-loaded files focused on rules that change agent behavior.

Agent effect:

- less fixed context before core work;
- higher salience for crate-boundary, SQL, async-lock, and verification rules;
- fewer stale prose claims competing with live code.

### 6. repair, eval, and LLM long functions

Refactor only when the corresponding domain is active. Their complexity is real
but more local, so they do not outrank the cross-cutting DB/API boundaries.

## PR sequence and gates

### R0 — make the reader census a real gate

Scope:

- explain and reconcile `191` generated vs `190` committed;
- regenerate the inventory from the merge baseline;
- add set-equality and partition checks suitable for CI;
- keep production behavior unchanged.

Required evidence:

- generator self-test;
- generated/current set equality;
- deliberate add/remove mutation makes the guard fail;
- Opus reviews the predicate and the positive control.

### R1 — externalize the main `db.rs` test module

Scope:

- move only the main test-module body;
- preserve `crate::db::tests::*`;
- preserve all test names and ignored-test entrypoints;
- no production movement.

Required evidence:

- before/after test-name inventory equality;
- focused `wenlan-core` library tests;
- workspace library tests;
- formatting and Clippy at the repository-standard layer;
- Opus diff review focused on lost fixtures, visibility, and cfg boundaries.

### R2 — migration dispatcher and historical migration modules

Scope:

- leave `run_migrations` as an ordered dispatcher;
- move immutable historical migration bodies in bounded version/domain groups;
- preserve ordering, backup timing, transaction boundaries, and
  `user_version` stamping;
- do not move migrations 98/99 until D5 clears.

Each PR moves one group only and includes upgrade/idempotence tests relevant to
that group.

### R3 — DB domain modules

Select the next domain by evidence:

1. outside the M5 protected surface;
2. cohesive public method set;
3. existing focused tests;
4. low cross-domain private-helper dependence.

One domain per PR. Keep method names and `MemoryDB` call sites unchanged.

### R4 — close direct connection access

Replace remaining external connection locks with bounded domain APIs. Make the
field private only after the caller census reaches its accepted floor.

### R5 — server vertical slices

Move route registration and handlers domain by domain. Preserve route identity,
typed request/response contracts, and `TrackedRouter` classification.

### R6 — `post_write` phase decomposition

Begin only after the M5 exact-base and truth-state reader/write paths have
settled. Preserve the one canonical facade.

### R7 — daemon startup and scheduler lanes

Separate orchestration from phase/lane implementations without changing startup
or scheduling order.

### R8 — instruction and verification-surface cleanup

Run after the code boundaries have stabilized so the documentation describes
the resulting architecture rather than predicting it.

## Review and team protocol

### Fable gate 1 — frozen design

Timing: now, after this document is written and before R0 implementation.

Fable reviews system shape only:

- whether the impact ordering follows the evidence;
- whether D5 contains the M5 PR-B/PR-C blast radius;
- whether R0 has real teeth and a positive control;
- whether the facade/child-module strategy avoids needless abstraction;
- whether the sequence separates movement from behavior;
- whether the end state materially improves agent code-writing conditions.

Expected verdict: `APPROVE`, `APPROVE-WITH-FIXES`, or `BLOCK`. All fixes land in
this document. Implementation starts only after the design verdict is clear.

### Intermediate PRs — Opus, not Fable

Every PR receives a focused Opus opinion or diff review against:

- the exact PR scope;
- the locked decisions above;
- the relevant SQL/API/transaction/test invariant;
- verifier evidence and positive controls.

Opus may identify a design-level contradiction. If resolving it would change a
locked decision or PR sequence, work stops and returns to Fable gate 1. Otherwise
Fable is not used for intermediate PRs.

### Fable gate 2 — final whole-refactor review

Timing: after the final planned refactor PR is implemented and all aggregate
gates pass, before declaring the refactor complete or merging the final closure
PR.

Fable compares the delivered system with this frozen design:

- original goals vs actual boundaries;
- cumulative behavior/API/SQL drift;
- whether temporary compatibility seams were removed or explicitly retained;
- whether agent navigation and bounded-change conditions materially improved;
- whether any PR-local compromise undermined the whole.

This is a system acceptance review, not another line-by-line code review.

### Team shape

- **Root/architect:** owns this document, PR boundaries, sequencing, and stop
  decisions.
- **One implementation worker:** writes the current bounded PR.
- **Opus reviewer:** provides the intermediate independent opinion/diff review.
- **Auditor:** independently runs inventories, positive controls, LSP/AST
  comparisons, and repository gates.

Reviewers and auditors do not edit the implementation while reviewing it.

## Aggregate completion criteria

The refactor is complete only when:

- R0's current-tree inventories pass by set equality;
- `db.rs` is a facade/orchestrator rather than the home of unrelated domain
  implementations and the giant inline test corpus;
- movement PRs have no intentional SQL, API, transaction, or behavior change;
- no new external direct DB connection access was introduced and the accepted
  end-state boundary is enforced;
- M5 claim/truth/reader contracts remain green;
- route, wire, and MCP typed contracts remain complete;
- repository-standard formatting, Clippy, workspace library tests, and any
  affected higher-layer tests pass after the final edit;
- Fable gate 2 approves the whole result.

LSP responsiveness is recorded before and after as an agent-impact measure. It
is supporting evidence, not the sole correctness gate, because language-server
timeouts also depend on tooling and machine state.

## Decision-change log

### 2026-07-28 — initial freeze candidate

- Baseline set to M5 PR-A merge `e4790ce8`.
- Reader-inventory freshness promoted to R0 after live output reported
  `191 / 22` while the committed inventory reported `190 / 22`.
- M5 PR-B/PR-C surfaces protected before broad movement.
- Review policy locked: Fable at frozen design and final system acceptance only;
  Opus for intermediate PR opinions and diff reviews.
